        As part of my final thesis requirement—for college—my colleagues and I
        were tasked to developr a prototype web system for the Professional
        Regulation Commision.

        This project was developed to fulfill a course requirement. My
        colleagues and I reached out to a small food business where we
        frequently ate and asked if we could develop a simple website for their
        business.
